# doTheCleaning
A really basic script which performs some integrity filesystem checks, image repair, clean and defrag drives and creates backups through Windows built-in tools.

## Built-in tools:
 - System File Checker (sfc.exe)
 - Deployment Image Servicing and Management (dism.exe)
 - Disk Cleanup (cleanmgr.exe)
 - Disk defragmentation (defrag.exe)
 - Backup creation (wbadmin.exe)
 - Check Disk (chkdsk.exe)
